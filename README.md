# Crime Finder
## This project was developed for the Dandyhacks 2018 Hackathon.

### This software is designed to work with crime data for Rochester, NY.
### A few machine learning algorithms analyze the data and learn it in order
### to make predictions on it, as to what crime is most likely to occur at
### what time and where that crime is likely to occur. This functionality
### could be used to enable the Rochester Police Department to make Rochester
### a safer place for the entirety of the population by monitoring crime-prone
### areas and enable them to be better prepared for the likely crime to occur.
