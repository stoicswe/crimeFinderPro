# Crime Finder

This project was developed for the Dandyhacks 2018 Hackathon.

This software is designed to work with crime data for Rochester, NY. A few machine learning algorithms analyze the data and learn it in order to make predictions on it, as to what crime is most likely to occur at what time and where that crime is likely to occur. This functionality could be used to enable the Rochester Police Department to make Rochester a safer place for the entirety of the population by monitoring crime-prone areas and enable them to be better prepared for the likely crime to occur.

## Getting Started

This project is not yet ready for professional deployment on host systems. It is rudimentary, but runnable under a host system, it is just the UI is not the most user friendly at the moment.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project, you will need:
```
Python 3.5 or newer
```
and you will need to install the following python packages, by running the following lines:
```
pip install pandas
pip install sklearn
pip install geoplotlib
pip install googlemaps
pip install tensorflow
```
Unless you already have the packages...in that case, you're pretty cool.
